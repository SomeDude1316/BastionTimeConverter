<h1>Bastion Timing Converter</h1>

A C# program that converts split times from a LiveSplit splits file (.lss) and exports to a new splits file in either timing method used by Bastion's autosplitter.

## Usage

First, ensure that your autosplitter settings for your splits file are correct. The program will not open the splits file if it detects a file for a game other than Bastion, or if it can't detect a category or autosplitter settings.

Simply open the file you want to convert, and you will see your personal best and sum of best times in both Skyway and Load timings. You can then export either of these timings to a new splits file. 

## Compatibility

This converter supports all categories present on the Bastion leaderboard.

NOTE: All Dreams and Challenges currently only correctly converts the old route. Support for the new route coming soon.
